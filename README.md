STOCK SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
1. Data Preprocessing and Text Cleaning:

Imports and Data Loading

• The code starts by importing necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib,
seaborn, nltk) used for data manipulation, visualization, and natural language
processing (NLP).
• It reads a CSV file (stock_senti_analysis.csv) containing stock sentiment data into a
pandas DataFrame (df). This DataFrame likely contains columns like 'Date', 'Label' (0
for down/same, 1 for up), and multiple columns of news headlines.
Handling Missing Data

• This step removes any rows in the DataFrame (df) that have missing values (NaN). It
ensures that the dataset is clean and ready for further analysis.
Text Preprocessing
• This section focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the text data (news headlines) in each
row of the DataFrame.
For each headline:
• Non-alphabetic characters are removed using regular expressions (re.sub()).
• Text is converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
• Tokenization splits the text into individual words.
• Stopwords (common words like 'the', 'is', 'and') are removed using NLTK's English
stopwords list.

• Words are stemmed using a stemming algorithm (PorterStemmer) to reduce them to
their root form.

• Cleaned headlines replace the original headlines in the DataFrame.
2. Building a Model and Training:

Splitting Data into Train and Test Sets

• The dataset (df) is split into training (train) and testing (test) sets based on a date
criterion. Typically, training data is before a certain date and testing data is after that
date, ensuring the model is evaluated on unseen data.
Creating Bag-of-Words Representation

• CountVectorizer is used to convert cleaned headline text (train_corpus and
test_corpus) into numerical features (X_train and X_test).
• Parameters like max_features limit the number of unique words considered, while
ngram_range=(2, 2) creates bigrams (pairs of consecutive words) which can capture
more context.
• Train and Test Corpus: Each row of headlines is combined into a single string
(train_corpus and test_corpus) for CountVectorizer input.
• Fit and Transform: fit_transform() learns the vocabulary and converts headlines into
a sparse matrix of token counts for training (X_train) and applies the same
transformation to test data (X_test).
Training Logistic Regression Model
• A Logistic Regression classifier (lr_classifier) is instantiated and trained on the
training data (X_train and y_train).

• The model learns to predict the 'Label' column (0 for down/same, 1 for up) based on
the bag-of-words representation of news headlines.

3. Model Evaluation and Prediction:

Model Evaluation Metrics

• Predict on Test Set: Using the trained model (lr_classifier), predictions (lr_y_pred)
are made on the test data (X_test).
• Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, and Recall are computed to evaluate how
well the model predicts the direction of stock movements.
• Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of predictions versus actual
outcomes (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives), aiding in
understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses.
Function for Stock Prediction
• Stock_prediction: Takes a sample news headline (sample_news) as input, cleans and
preprocesses it similarly to the training data, transforms it into numerical features
using the already fitted CountVectorizer (cv), and predicts sentiment using the
trained logistic regression model(lr_classifier).

Predicting Sentiment for Sample News

Demonstrates how to use stock_prediction() function to predict sentiment for a sample
news headline (sample_news) and interpret the prediction (up or down/stay the same).

Conclusion:
This detailed explanation covers the process of preparing data, building a sentiment analysis
model, training it, evaluating its performance, and using it for predictions. The integration of
financial metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, number of trades executed, and
win ratio would further enhance the assessment of the model's effectiveness in real-world
financial decision-making contexts

Accuracy score:

Number of Trades executed:
Counts the total number of trades executed based on predictions made by the model.

Win Ratio:
Win ratio calculates the proportion of correct predictions relative to the total number of
trades executed.
